# Algorithm_Visualizer
###### Algorithm Visualizer is one of the coolest Web Developement Project in the field of Software Engineering. This project visualize the speed of 6 sorting algorithms used that are Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Selection sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort. This project is the greatest example of separation of concerns concept of software designing.
This project help us to understand the intuition behind the basic sorting algorithms and their speed based on the size of input array
